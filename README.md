# Classical Encryption Algorithms

This repository contains my implementation of the classical encryption algorithms that I am learning and also the attacks that break the algorithm.

## Encryption Algorithms Added :closed_lock_with_key:
1. Keyed Transposition Algorithm
2. Ceaser Cipher


## Attacks Added :crossed_swords:
1. Keyed Transposition algorithm: Brute Force
  

## Contribution :people_hugging:

This is an open source project, and contributions of any kind are welcome and appreciated.
